<p>The steps that happen in the figure above:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When a user types in a url, that query is sent to a DNS Server first.</li>
  <li>DNS Server maps the url to an public IP address and sends it back to the client.</li>
  <li>A HTTP request with query parameters and headers are sent to the server.</li>
  <li>The load balancer based on the loads of each of the servers will send the request to one of them.</li>
  <li>App server will do some computations, meanwhile interacting with some Database.</li>
  <li>The database will pull up some stored data based on the query.</li>
  <li>The server finally sends the HTTP response with the content back to the client.</li>
